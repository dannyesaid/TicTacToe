# Pygame-Tic-Tac-Toe

I coded this game using the Python Pygame libary.

You may download the executable and dependencies folder to play the game.
Please keep the dependencies folder in the same directory as the executable.

Below is a picture of the game.
A demonstration of the game is also provided in the repository as a video.
